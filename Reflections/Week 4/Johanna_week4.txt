Reflection - Week 4

what do I want to learn or understand better?
To get to know the Scrum Master role and feel comfortable in it is still one of my goals. 
This week we got started with the project "for real" and I now have a better view of how
to fulfil my role as Scrum Master within this project. There is still a lot more to
learn about the role, so I believe I will have this goal as part of my goals for the
duration of the part of the project when I have it.

I have realised, while working on this project, that I find some of our user stories and
how they have been divided into task in need of improvement. Therefore, my new goal for the
comming week is to be better at defining goals and divide them into tasks.

how can I help someone else, or the entire team, to learn something new?
By sharing my knowledge and experience when needed and give help when someone need it.

what is my contribution towards the team’s use of Scrum?
Actively participating in meetings and decision making, as every week. I have been 
given an assignment connected to my role as Scrum Master, to keep track of the Trello board
and points in the different categories, which I have done. I have also brought up the topic
of reflection at the end of the sprint and proposed a date when to do it.

what is my contribution towards the team’s deliveries?
I have participated in the coding of one of our project's main functions.
