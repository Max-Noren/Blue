Self reflection, week 4.

What do I want to learn or understand better?
- I want to learn more about our testing environment, and PHP in general. 

How can I help someone else, or the entire team, to learn something new?
- By discussing and learning things *together*. I think doing tasks together with someone has worked really well for this.

What is my contribution towards the team’s use of Scrum?
- I participated in our meeting where we went over and ranked our user stories in preparation for this week's sprint.
- I shared my notes from the TA meeting so we wouldn't forget any of the received feedback.
- I took part in our meeting about updating our social contract and expanding our definition of done. 
- I identified a disconnect between the tasks and the purpose of a user story in this week's sprint and suggested changes. 

What is my contribution towards the team’s deliveries?
- My team worked on selecting the testing environment and setting it up.
- We wrote a simple test for a function in the code to make sure the environment is working correctly.
- Then we researched emission averages and displayed them in the app for the user to compare.
- It was decided we would be the designated testing team for future tests within the project as well.
