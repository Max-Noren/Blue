Week 4 - Felix Brunengård

This week has been challenging because I did as I wrote in last week's reflection, and took a User story that's outside my comfort zone. But I and Max did it!
I also said that I was available for more effort points than I actually could allocate this week because I forgot that I was unavailable one day. This is a little funny because that is exactly what the guest lecturer said happens. That he has to remind people of their vacation and so on.

what do I want to learn or understand better?
    Next week I will be focus on learning some URL encoders. Because right now out input fields can't take ÅÄÖ. I think the answer is close but I still can't fix it...
how can I help someone else, or the entire team, to learn something new?
    This week I don't really have a good new answer to this question. But we will continue like in week 3.
what is my contribution towards the team’s use of Scrum?
    I attended the guest lecture this week to get some real-life stories of what's it like to be a scrum master. And I and some others in the team discussed how to utilize this information in the team and explained to them who missed the lecture.
what is my contribution towards the team’s deliveries?
    For next week I will be listening to my PO and Scrum master and do the assignments that I am assigned (as every other week). And try to take solo user stories so we can work more effectively.
