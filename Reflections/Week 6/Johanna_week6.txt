Reflection - Week 6

what do I want to learn or understand better?
I feel that we as a group has become better at defining clear and resonable assignments
for the week. The thing I want to become better at next week is to estimate the number of 
points a task will take, which I believe I, and we as a group, have struggled with.

how can I help someone else, or the entire team, to learn something new?
By sharing my knowledge and experience when needed and give help when someone need it.

what is my contribution towards the team’s use of Scrum?
Actively participating in meetings and decision making, as every week. I have kept track 
of the user story assignments for each week and how many points we take on vs how many we
finish. This week I put the numbers into tables which I shared with the rest of the group.

what is my contribution towards the team’s deliveries?
I, together with Felix and Felicia, have worked with trying to get public transport information
from Västtrafik by using their API, which turned out to be more difficult than expected since it
is not well documented. Unfortunately we were not able to finish it during this week's sprint, but
we made good progress so hopefully we will be able to finish it next week.
