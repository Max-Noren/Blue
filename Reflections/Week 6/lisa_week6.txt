previous week:

This week I manly did a user story with Felicia. We created a method that would print out carbon equivalence for the trip in everyday items(plastic bags etc). 
What I learned was that we should ask the group about their thoughts before starting to code. It was in the user story a task that we should discuss and decide
how to display this and also with what we should compare with. So we did that and wrote a method. When we were done we created a pull request, and it wasn't exactly
how all the other thought it should be done. So we got some great feedback and discussed how we could do it instead and then changed it. So we basically wrote the function
for this twice, because the second time around we still used the same items we found but we calculated and displayed the results in a whole other way. It ended up being
more conhesive with the other parts of the website output so it looks nicer now. We also decided, between us two in the end, that we should do a random comparison, aka
sometimes it compares to plastic bags, sometimes with cheese sandwithces etc. Because there was too much information otherways (less customaer value because it was too much). 
Overall this made the task come closer to the actual effort points that were set for the user story. So we came close to our estimated effort points this week. 

Next week I hope to be able to contribuate to updating the user interface to make the website prettier. That can be a challange as I have not done much of that in php. 
So far I just know how to make larger text sometimes... But I also have an extreamly (!) stressful week next week in the other course I'm taking. So I'll be glas if I can spend just a little time in this course then. Since this course is so much more fun, I'm hoping it wont be a too big issue. 
Overall I still think the collaboration in the group works well, everyone seems to be engaged and attending meetings, writing code etc. I know for myself I could improve on asking
the testing team for testing the code I write. Right now I often just do trial-and-error testing myself, seeing if I get the correct output on the website. But this should be easier next week as we have decided to push to a test-branch instead of pushing directly to main. 

In summation with the individual reflection questions:
what do I want to learn or understand better?
  - I want to learn more about how to do pretty user interface
  - I would like to learn to write better tasks to the user stories I'm working on. Sometimes I write them as checklists instead, but I end up editing/deleting them. So I could definetely improve on that.
how can I help someone else, or the entire team, to learn something new?
 - By being active in discussions we have in our meetings. 
 - By coding toghether and findning new relevant information for the task/user storie we are working on.
what is my contribution towards the team’s use of Scrum?
 - I make sure to update my/my groups cards in trello. I have also reminded some groups about updating theirs and also assigning people to every card, so that there's no un-assigned cards in progress. 
  - I have started writing useful information about my cards in trello. Comments that the others can read if they liek when rewieving a pull request.
  - I contribuate to our meetings. Ask questions etc, we discuss a lot of things. 
what is my contribution towards the team’s deliveries?
 - I think that's pretty well described above, both in text but also in the other questions.
