This week I did two smaller user stories, mostly because I did not have a lot of effort or time to put in this week since my other course was a lot this week, but I knew this beforehand and planned accordingly. I think my user stories ended up matching the effort points I comitted to, although they were estimated to more effort from the beginning. My first user story exactly matched my remaining effort points but it was quicker and simpler than expected so on wednesday I commited to another user story as well. With that one I ran into some problems, I have requested help with that. I also did some logo suggestions for our website. Next week we plan to finalize the app monday-wednesday, and later start with our report for the course.

In summation with the individual reflection questions:
what do I want to learn or understand better?
  - I want to learn more about how to do pretty user interface (same as last week)
  - I would like to learn to help the group do better effort estimations for the user stories. They are still not quite on track.
how can I help someone else, or the entire team, to learn something new?
 - By being active in discussions we have in our meetings. We do already have a very open discussion climat, I feel like everyone has a chance to get their voice heard. But I guess I could also try to notice if someone isn't speeking so much, and ask them for their input as well.  
 - I could share my experiences and input when we for example estimate user stories, to make them closer to reality.
what is my contribution towards the team’s use of Scrum?
 - I make sure to update my user story cards in trello and also to make relevant tasks in forms of checklists or task-cards.
 - I am active in our scrum-sprint planning meetings.
 - I have started writing useful information about my cards in trello. Comments that the others can read if they liek when reviewing a pull request.
what is my contribution towards the team’s deliveries?
 - I think that's pretty well described above, both in text but also in the other questions. 
 - I also try to be active with reviewing the other team members pull requests, since we have decided that everyone should review and accept a pull request before merging into main this allows the groups flow to be better. I have also pointed out the importance of this during a meeting this week, since all of our pull requests tends to be left until the end of the week since all group members don´t do this. But I also understand that it takes time and some might not have the time to look at a pull request immidietely.
