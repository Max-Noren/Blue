Reflection - Week 5

what do I want to learn or understand better?
Since we are a small team working with a small project entirely defined by ourselves I believe
we work a bit differently from a team working with a "real" project. Our team members are good at
keeping the members in the group updated on the parts of the project they are working on, which 
makes my role as Scrum Master easier. The main thing I do is to keep track of assignments in the
Trello board.

My goal for last week was to become better at defining goals and divide them into tasks, which I 
though was a bit difficult. I still think it should be my goal, since I feel I still have room to
improve.

how can I help someone else, or the entire team, to learn something new?
By sharing my knowledge and experience when needed and give help when someone need it.

what is my contribution towards the team’s use of Scrum?
Actively participating in meetings and decision making, as every week. I have kept track 
of the user story assignments for each week and how many points we take on vs how many we
finish.

what is my contribution towards the team’s deliveries?
I, together with Max, have this week worked with putting together the different parts of
the code so that everything works together.
