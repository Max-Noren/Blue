Reflection - Week 3

what do I want to learn or understand better?
Last week I said I wanted to get to know the Scrum Master role and feel comfortable in it.
This is still one of my goals. Since we have not quite gotten started with the project, the way the 
role will work in this project is a bit unclear.

how can I help someone else, or the entire team, to learn something new?
By sharing my knowledge and experience when needed and give help when someone need it.

what is my contribution towards the team’s use of Scrum?
Actively participating in meetings and decision making.

what is my contribution towards the team’s deliveries?
This week I have manage to get the software to work properly on my computer so
that I efficiently can contribute to the coding part of the project.
