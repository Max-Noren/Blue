I would like to understand html and php better since those are the programming languages we are going to be using throughout the project. I wil do this by first looking at
a beginner youtube video, then by simply coding and trying to complete some tasks. I have already planned to do some group coding with Johanna and Felicia in the beginning of next
week. That way we'll be able to learn it together since we are all new to this (php/html).
During this sprint I have learned at least some of the basics of html/php and I think as a group that we have structured the trello board really nice, it feels like a great way
to work with and learn the agile approach and scrum. We have agreed to have 3 meetings/week (mon, wed, fri) instead of daily scrum. But if we are currently working on a task,
we make it clear in trello so it sort of becomes a smaller daily scrum board as well where we can see what everyone is doing at the moment. I will try my best to use it as we
have agreed to! The team's deliveries this week was only a simple page to calculate grams of co2/km based on manual inputs. I wrote the calculating function and its output. Also
everyone submitted a hello wrold file in php and made sure to install xampp etc. Several of us had problems with this but thankfully Felix could help set it up. 
Overall I think it was a great getting-started week. Johanna and I were very busy monday-thursday with a deadline in another course so we did not have time to sepand on this sprint
outside of the meetings, but I did my best to complete the tasks in time: hello world, went to the meetings and wrote some code in php + set up a branch on friday.
