Reflection - Week 7

what do I want to learn or understand better?
I think we have become better at estimating what a reasonable amount of points for a
task is in relation to other assignments, though we seem to have some trouble 
estimating, in the beginning of the week, how much we will be able to complete during
the week. This means we have to decide new assignments in the middle of the week, which
has worked so far, but could cause problems.

how can I help someone else, or the entire team, to learn something new?
By sharing my knowledge and experience when needed and give help when someone needs it.
This week I shared how to create a graph from a table in Excel.

what is my contribution towards the team’s use of Scrum?
Actively participating in meetings and decision making, as every week. I and Irja put
together information about each sprint and created graphs for our KPI.

what is my contribution towards the team’s deliveries?
We, Felix, Felicia and I, finished the assignment with getting the time public transport will take 
from one coordinate to another from Västtrafik and incorperating the function we created into the rest
of the program.

Lisa and I added tooltips to some of the information in the table.
