Reflections week 7

What do I want to learn or understand better?
- I'd like to learn what it's like to work in an even bigger team. How to keep things from becoming chaotic.

How can I help someone else, or the entire team, to learn something new?
- Now that the project is in its end stages, it would be nice to look back at the tools we've used, and 
their shortcomings. For example, my biggest gripe with the trello board is that there isn't a good way of 
linking subtasks/user stories to parent tasks/epics (that would update automatically), meaning we don't 
really get an overview of those relations. 

What is my contribution towards the team’s use of Scrum?
- I participated in the velocity/sprint planning meeting.
- I shared my notes on the TA feedback, to reflect on after the meeting.

What is my contribution towards the team’s deliveries?
- I took part in writing the readme file and the project wiki on github.
- I first worked alone in gathering the relevant data from our trello activity needed for one of our KPIs, 
and was later joined by Johanna. We then made graphs for all the KPIs and kept track of the data for the 
current week as well.
