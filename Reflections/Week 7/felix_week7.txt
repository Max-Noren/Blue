Week 7 - Felix Brunengård

WE MADE IT. We completed the last sprint.

what do I want to learn or understand better?
  	As of the end of this sprint, I have a quite clear image of show scrum works. However as stated at the beginning of the course, there is no right version of Scrum. All organizations have their own take, so my goal is to find the scrum that is best suited for me. And I am as week speak not that great at updating cards on Trello. So, of course, I would like to improve in that area as well. This is best done by keeping using the tool. 

how can I help someone else, or the entire team, to learn something new?
    Now as we have done this last sprint, I would like to continue using some type of Scrum in my next programming project.

what is my contribution towards the team’s use of Scrum?
   I made sure to try to keep commenting on my Trello cards, do my user stories to the best ability. Also attending all meetings and giving my feedback when necessary. I have also discussed much with some team members about testing. And we, therefore, asked the TA and teacher about what is required in the project.

what is my contribution towards the team’s deliveries?
    N/A
