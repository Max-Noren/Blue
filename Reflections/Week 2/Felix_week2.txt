Week 2 - Felix Bruneng√•rd

This week is the last week before the projectstart. This week we created the project scope and the epics in our Trello board.

As we decided to use PHP my goal is to learn more PHP. I have used basic PHP before in high school, but I am excited to learn more. And we're going to implement a map, so my plan is to be assigned that epic, so I can learn more about implementing api's

I and one more is the only people in the group that have used PHP. So next week we can show the group how to set up a PHP document and the syntax.
