Week 2 - my own reflections

This week has been good for the team. We have organized and planned for future mettings, made a trello board, decided who should be PO and scrum master, come up with the project scope, we made a buissness model canvas with a mockup etc. 
It's been a good week for the start of our project. :) 
I think myself and everyone in the team has made a good job working together to write the project scope, come up with epics/stories/tasks for the trello board as well as be active
in the conversations within the team.
