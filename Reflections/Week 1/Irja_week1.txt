Communication is very important, ask questions rather than assuming anything whenever a task is ambiguous. 
Separating tasks into smaller but still individually valuable parts was good advice. 
It's good to consider if it's worth it to allocate more resources to a task rather than report that it won't be done in time.
Pay attention to the priorities of the user stories.
