Reflection Week 1 Felix Brunneg√•rd:

This first week has been interesting and inspiring for me. The team exercises have been forcing us to think for ourselves and use teamwork in different ways to get things done with good communication, I liked how you made us realize the importance of talking with the P.O.

In this situation we are in now there is not much I can help the team or a person to learn, except maybe some software or website I have come across before my studies, such as Trello, MS whiteboard, etc.

My contribution towards the team's use of Scrum is still unclear at this stage. I have experience in leadership, and I am used to be the organizer of meetings, so maybe Scrum master. However, in my team, it feels like most of the people could fit as a Scrum master.

This week we have not had many deliveries except writing of the social contract where I contributed to de discussion while we made the social contract. And I also took the task to create the Scrum board in Trello.
