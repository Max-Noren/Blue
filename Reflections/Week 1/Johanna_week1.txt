Reflection - Week 1

Since we are at the beginning of the course, I want to learn more about
working agile and scrum. I also hope to learn more about programming
projects and how to manage them.

This week we wrote our social contract and started to get to know each 
other, through both meeting and exercises. By participating in the exercises
I have learned more about working together in sprints.
